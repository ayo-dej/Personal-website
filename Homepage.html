    <h2 id="title">Summary</h2>

    <hr/>

    <p id="info">
        A highly analytical, detail oriented and technology-driven Computer Engineering graduate
         that combines computer science knowledge with that of electrical engineering to build new 
         computers and tackle problems with existing computer systems. I also have a strong in-depth
          knowledge of design, analytics, algorithms, analysis tools, and object-oriented modeling. 
          Through multiple collaborations with a team of fellow engineers, my critical and creative 
          thinking as well as excellent communication and problem-solving skills have been developed. 
          To further demonstrate my knowledge and eagerness to learn, I have also attained the AWS 
          Certified Cloud Practitioner Certificate.

                    A highly analytical, detail oriented and technology-driven Computer Engineering graduate
                    that combines computer science knowledge with that of electrical engineering to build new 
                    computers and tackle problems with existing computer systems. I also have a strong in-depth
                    knowledge of design, analytics, algorithms, analysis tools, and object-oriented modeling. 
                    Through multiple collaborations with a team of fellow engineers, my critical and creative 
                    thinking as well as excellent communication and problem-solving skills have been developed. 
                    To further demonstrate my knowledge and eagerness to learn, I have also attained the AWS 
                    Certified Cloud Practitioner Certificate.
